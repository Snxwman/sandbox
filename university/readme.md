# University Classes
Some of the code I wrote while in university and find interesting enough to keep around.
Code in here may be incomplete, incorrect, unoptimized, etc.
Code appears as an archive, exactly how it was at the time.

## Organization of Programming Languages
[`largest-rectangle.rkt`](largest-rectangle.rkt) -
Finds the largest rectangle in a list of rectangles.
Rectangles are specified as a list of numbers in the form `(x1 y1 x2 y2)`
where `(x1, y1)`, and `(x2, y2)` are the coordintes of the top left and bottom left corners, respectively.

[`intersecting-rectangles.rkt`](intersecting-rectangles.rkt) -
Finds the list of rectangles intersecting with a given rectangle on a grid.
Rectangles are specified the same as above.

[`fsm.rkt`](fsm.rkt) -
A finite state machine that evaluates if a given string is valid for the finite state machine specified by a 5-tuple.

## Space Mechanics
[`OMech.m`](OMech.m) -
The final project for my orbital mechanics course.
Simulates and plots the orbital propagation of a satellite.

## Rocket Propulsion
[`lunal-ascent.m`](lunar-ascent.m) -
Final project for my rocket propulsion course.
Simulates and plots the ascent of a lunar lander from the surface to a 55km circular orbit.
